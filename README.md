# Applied_AI_ML

This repository contains my learning journey in Applied Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning over 5 months.  
It includes Python foundations, AI & ML core concepts, Deep Learning, Computer Vision, and NLP applications.

Each folder corresponds to a major topic area, with subfolders containing notebooks, scripts, mini-projects, and resources.
